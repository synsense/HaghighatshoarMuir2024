# multi-mic SNN localization

In this project, we restart the DoA estimation and localization project using a multi-mic array.

In this new version of the project, we have found a new method to resolve several issues:
- ambiguity in DoA estimation due to real-valued signals is resolved.
- a new method using online Hilbert tranbsform is developed which has the potential to be used for a wide range of signal processing applications.
